# ✅ FINAL SETUP - Working Instructions

## 🎉 Webapp is Ready!

The webapp is now fully configured and working!

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Just One Command:

```bash
cd /home/pranav/Software_Lab/webapp
npm run dev
```

The server will start and show:
```
▲ Next.js 15.5.4 (Turbopack)
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 🌐 Access the Webapp

Open in your browser:
**http://localhost:3000**

(If port 3000 is busy, it will use 3001 - just check the terminal output)

---

## 📝 Try It!

Enter a project description like:

```
Create an e-commerce platform with:
- Product catalog with search and filters
- Shopping cart and checkout
- Payment integration with Stripe
- Order management dashboard
- Customer authentication
- Email notifications
- Mobile responsive design
```

Click **"Analyze Project"** and watch the AI break it down!

## 🔧 Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Source Files**: Parent project sources are copied to `lib/parent/`
2. **Imports**: Webapp imports from `./parent/AIAgentSystem`
3. **AI**: Uses Google Gemini via parent's `.env` file
4. **UI**: Built with Next.js 15 + React 19 + Tailwind CSS 4

### File Structure

```

## 🛑 Stop the Server

Press **Ctrl + C** in the terminal

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Module Not Found Error

If you see module errors, the parent sources need to be copied:

```bash
cd /home/pranav/Software_Lab/webapp
cp -r ../src/* lib/parent/
npm run dev
```

### API Key Error

Make sure `/home/pranav/Software_Lab/.env` has your GEMINI_API_KEY:

```bash
cat /home/pranav/Software_Lab/.env | grep GEMINI
```

### Port In Use

The server will automatically use the next available port (3001, 3002, etc.)
Just check the terminal output for the correct URL.
