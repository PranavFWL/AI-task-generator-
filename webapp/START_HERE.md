## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If you see "Port 3000 is in use", the server will automatically use port 3001.
Just open http://localhost:3001 instead.

### Module Not Found Error

Make sure the parent project is built:

```bash
cd /home/pranav/Software_Lab
npm run build
cd webapp
npm run dev
```

### API Key Error

Ensure `/home/pranav/Software_Lab/.env` contains your GEMINI_API_KEY:

```bash
cat /home/pranav/Software_Lab/.env | grep GEMINI_API_KEY
```
