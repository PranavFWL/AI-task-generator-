# AgentTask-AI

AI Powered Project Task Breakdown System

AgentTask-AI is a modern web application that uses Google Gemini AI to convert high-level project briefs into detailed, actionable technical tasks. It works on a multi-agent system where each AI agent focuses on a specific domain such as coordination, frontend, or backend.

---

## Features

* AI-powered analysis that understands project descriptions and creates structured tasks
* Detailed task cards including title, type, estimated hours, dependencies, and acceptance criteria
* Modern interface built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS
* Multi-agent system for coordinated task generation
* Full-stack code generation for both frontend and backend
* One-command setup for easy installation and launch

## Quick Start

### Linux, macOS, or WSL

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PranavFWL/AI-task-generator-.git
cd AI-task-generator-
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

### Windows

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/PranavFWL/AI-task-generator-.git
cd AI-task-generator-
install.bat
```

The installation script checks dependencies, installs all required packages, and helps you set up your Gemini API key.

## Manual Setup

1. Clone and install

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PranavFWL/AI-task-generator-.git
   cd AI-task-generator-
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Add your Gemini API key inside `.env.local`

   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Run

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## How It Works

1. The user provides a natural language project description.
2. Gemini AI analyzes the description and breaks it down into technical tasks.
3. The Coordinator Agent manages dependencies and assigns tasks.
4. The Frontend and Backend Agents generate production-level code.
5. The entire project is packaged into a downloadable full-stack application.

## Tech Stack

Frontend

* Next.js 15
* React 19
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS 4

Backend

* Node.js with Express
* PostgreSQL or MySQL
* JWT authentication
* bcrypt for hashing
* node-cron and Bull for background jobs

AI Integration

* Google Gemini API

## API

Endpoint: POST /api/analyze

Request

```json
{
  "description": "Build a todo app with authentication and real-time updates"
}
```

Response

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "task-1",
      "title": "Setup frontend project",
      "type": "frontend",
      "estimatedHours": 4,
      "dependencies": [],
      "acceptance_criteria": ["Project runs successfully"]

## Commands

| Command       | Description              |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| npm run dev   | Start development server |
| npm run build | Build for production     |
| npm start     | Start production server  |
| npm run lint  | Run ESLint checks        |

## Troubleshooting

* Make sure Node.js version is 18 or higher
* Verify the Gemini API key in `.env.local`
* Check that port 3000 is not already in use
